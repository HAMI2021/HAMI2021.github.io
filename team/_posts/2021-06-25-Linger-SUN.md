### Education Background
Ph.D. The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), 2020 - present

### Self Introduction
I am currently a first-year PhD student at School of Data Science, CUHK(SZ). 
The first time that I contact with operations management in healthcare was the summer of my junior year. That summer, I had a chance to join a research group dealing with scheduling problem in a large hospital. During several field trips, I experienced the chaos and inefficiency in that hospital, and was determined to make some change. From then on, I dive into this OM field and select this direction as my research field.
The research project that I have been involved in aims to solve an appointment schedule and a revisit schedule to improve the effectiveness of the hospitalâ€™s daily operations. I am mainly responsible for numerical experiments and part of proof for the convergence of the proposed algorithm. 
In addition to my engaged research life, I would like to make my leisure time colorful. I love drawing, playing guitar, going skateboarding, watching movies, and chasing fashion.
