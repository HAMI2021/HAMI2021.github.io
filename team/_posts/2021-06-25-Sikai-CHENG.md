### Self Introduction
I have always been fascinated by the vibrant and colorful world, especially the assortment of visual arts. I love Edvard Munch's paintings, and I am always drawn into his fervent color expressions and ardent visual impact. I appreciate his inimitable view of painting as "the study of the soul," and he has also practiced this throughout his life. Every time I look at his paintings, I immediately receive the special meaning he wants to convey behind the blood-red sky, the bluish-black fjord full of fear stretched by the tongues of fire and blood. There are many other similar examples. The warmth and beauty, tenderness, and delicacy in Martin Frank's black and white photography of people are unique to me. I admire the exquisitely designed empty spaces in Tadao Ando's architecture. Any kind of communication and discussion is welcome.
