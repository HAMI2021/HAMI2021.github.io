### About me
I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at the Krannert School of Management, Purdue University. I joined Krannert in Janurary 2014 and my tenure will be effective in August 2021. I am an affiliate faculty of the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering and the Integrative Data Science Initiative.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology in December 2013. I received my B.Eng. in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics and B.A. in Economics (double major) from Peking University, China, in June 2007. My Ph.D. advisors are Jim Dai and Pinar Keskinocak. Here is a copy of my Ph.D. thesis.

### Research
My research focuses on building data-driven, high fidelity models and developing predictive and prescriptive analytics to support decisions making under uncertainty in healthcare and service systems.

One of my main research stream is to develop patient flow models to improve hospital operations and patient outcomes. This stream of research has been implmeneted as tools for supporting inpatient discharge management and for supporting COVID-19 response in the hospital systems in Indiana. Recently, I have started working on developing predictive and operations tool for criminal justice system.

My research methodologies include stochastic models, queueing theory, Markov decision process, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and online learning. See my publications and here for a guest lecture I gave on applying reinforcement learning to tackle large-scale decision problems in hospital operations and criminal justice system. I am currently serving as an Associate Editor of Operations Research, Health Care Management Science, Service Science, and Decision Sciences.

I strive to develop high impact research and tackle real-world problems. I have been collaborating with practitioners and faculty members from different healthcare organizations and goverment agencies, publishing on medical journals. I have worked extensively with large-scale data sets from hospitals in the US, Singapore, and China.

I have had the pleasure of working closely with PhD students and undergraduate students. Graduate students with solid theoretical background could check out this research opportunity Deep-learning Enhanced Healthcare Modeling and Optimization. Purdue undergraduate students are encouraged to apply through my DURI project.
