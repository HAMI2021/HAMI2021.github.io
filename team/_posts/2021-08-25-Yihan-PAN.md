### Education Background

B.B.A. Economic Science, The Chinese University of Hongkong (Shenzhen), 2021

### Self Introduction

Majoring in Economics, I enjoy standing upon the view of a social planner, seek optimums for the whole social coordinations and move the world forward; meanwhile, I also love to apply technical tools from data analytics to let all the ideas happen. Healthcare operations management perfectly combines my interests, in which mathematics and programming serve as a critical tool in solving real hospital operational problems. Conducting research under the supervision of our distinguished and caring professors for the past two years has always been the best start point of my research career in healthcare operations. In my spare time, I love cooking, skiing and movies.
